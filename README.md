- ### Suit the job  |  [GitHub Repo](https://github.com/dnlap/Suit-the-job)
  
  A resume classification model using a Linkedin dataset obtained from Kaggle. 
  The job postings are classified in 2 classes: "STEM" or "not STEM".
  There are plenty of popular skills for these jobs.

  Word embeddings are also used to extract knowledge from the skills.

  This task evolves into a more vertical job market analysis, focusing primarily on the “Data Science” field, which is of particular interest. For this reason, a specific job posting dataset provided by Kaggle is used. After some data preprocessing and EDA, a job recommender is built, based just on the cosine similarity between TF-IDF vectors previously calculated from resumes and job offers.
