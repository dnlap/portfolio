### Suit the job
[GitHub Repo](https://github.com/dnlap/Suit-the-job)

A resume classification model using a Linkedin dataset obtained from Kaggle. 
The job postings are classified in 2 classes: "STEM" or "not STEM".
There are plenty of popular skills for these jobs.

Word embeddings are also used to extract knowledge from the skills.

This task evolves into a more vertical job market analysis, focusing primarily on the “Data Science” field, which is of particular interest. For this reason, a specific job posting dataset provided by Kaggle is used. After some data preprocessing and EDA, a job recommender is built, based just on the cosine similarity between TF-IDF vectors previously calculated from resumes and job offers.

### Search Engine - Inverted Index
[GitHub Repo](https://github.com/F-Zinga/MIRCV-project)

A search engine for text retrieval, leveraging an inverted index structure based on the MSMARCO Passages collection. The goal is to efficiently process queries and rank relevant documents for users.
